## Overview

Created a comprehensive relational database for an e-commerce platform supporting direct transactions between brand owners and customers. The system is built to ensure normalized data, efficient querying, and reliable reporting across business operations.

## Key Features

- **Entity Relationship Modeling**: Designed an ER diagram encompassing users (admin, customers, brand owners), product categories, transactions, and inventory flows.
- **Transaction Management**: Supported full purchase workflows including cart, orders, shipping, and payments with secure data linking.
- **Inventory Analytics**: Enabled brand owners to monitor inventory movement and sales trends through structured SQL queries and views.
- **User Roles & Access**: Implemented role-based data access to customize views for admins, customers, and sellers.

## Technologies Used

- **SQL (PostgreSQL)** – for schema development and data querying.
- **ERD Tools (ERD Plus)** – for diagram visualization.
- **Stored Procedures & Views** – for repeatable business logic and reporting.

## Outcome

Delivered a scalable, secure, and analytics-ready e-commerce database schema — with an ERD that aligns with backend integration and reporting requirements. The system supports future extension and is ready for production-level integration.
